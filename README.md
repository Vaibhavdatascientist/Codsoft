Task 1 (Sales Prediction Using Python) Unbinding the power of data - Sales Prediction Using Python. #task1 by CodSoft I've utilized diverse analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret data in order to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

Task 2 (Fraud Detection) I'm elated to share my latest Data Science project - Credit Card Fraud Detection. task2 by CodSoft. It is crucial that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions in such a manner that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. With this in mind, I selected a real-world dataset and performed data preparation and cleaning. Then, I used machine learning algorithm to analyze fraudulent transactions. The project also included exploratory analysis and visualization.Let's have a look at how various techniques produce robust support against monetary threats.
